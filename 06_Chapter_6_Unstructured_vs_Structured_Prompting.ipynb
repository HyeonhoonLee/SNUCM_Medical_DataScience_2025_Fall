The six pillars of the Framework allow you to learn architectural best practices for designing and operating reliable, secure, efficient, cost-effective, and sustainable systems. Using the AWS Well-Architected Tool, available at no charge in the AWS Management Console, you can review your workloads against these best practices by answering a set of questions for each pillar.\n",

        "AWS makes it easy to deploy your workloads in AWS by creating resources, such as Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon EBS volumes, security groups, and AWS Lambda functions. You can also scale and grow the ﬂeet of AWS resources that hosts your applications, stores your data, and expands your AWS infrastructure over time. As your AWS usage grows to many resource types spanning multiple applications, you will need a mechanism to track which resources are assigned to which application. Use this mechanism to support your operational activities, such as cost monitoring, incident management, patching, backup, and access control.\n",
        "In on-premises environments, this knowledge is often captured in knowledge management systems, document management systems, and on internal wiki pages. With a configuration management database (CMDB), you can store and manage the relevant detailed metadata using standard change control processes. This approach provides governance, but requires additional effort to develop and maintain. You can take a structured approach to the naming of resources, but a resource name can only hold a limited amount of information.\n",
        "\n",
        "One of the first tagging use cases organizations often tackle is visibility and management of cost and usage. There are usually a few reasons for this:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. It's typically a well understood scenario and requirements are well known. For example, finance teams want to see the total cost of workloads and infrastructure that span across multiple services, features, accounts, or teams. One way to achieve this cost visibility is through consistent tagging of resources.\n",
        "2. Tags and their values are clearly defined. Usually, cost allocation mechanisms already exist in an organization’s finance systems, for example, tracking by cost center, business unit, team, or organization function\n",
        "3. Rapid, demonstrable return on investment. It’s possible to track cost optimization trends over time when resources are tagged consistently, for example, for resources that were rightsized, auto-scaled, or put on a schedule.\n",
        "Understanding how you incur costs in AWS allows you to make informed financial decisions. Knowing where you have incurred costs at the resource, workload, team, or organization level enhances your understanding of the value delivered at the applicable level when compared to the business outcomes achieved.\n",
        "The engineering teams might not have experience with financial management of their resources. Attaching a person with a specialized skill in AWS financial management who can train engineering and development teams on the basics of AWS financial management and create a relationship between finance and engineering to foster the culture of FinOps will help achieve measurable outcomes for the business and encourage teams to build with cost in mind. Establishing good financial practices is covered in depth by the Cost Optimization Pillar of the Well-Architected Framework, but we will touch on a few of the fundamental principles in this whitepaper.\n",
        "AWS resources can be tagged for a variety of purposes, from implementing a cost allocation strategy to supporting automation or authorizing access to AWS resources. Implementing a tagging strategy can be challenging for some organizations, owing to the number of stakeholder groups involved and considerations such as data sourcing and tag governance.\n",
        "In this whitepaper, we’ve outlined recommendations regarding designing and implementing a tagging strategy in an organization based on operational practices, defined use cases, stakeholders involved in the process, and tools and services provided by AWS. When it comes to a tagging strategy, it’s a process of iteration and improvement, where you start small from your immediate priority, identify relevant use cases across your organization, and then implement and grow the tagging schema as you need to, while continuously measuring and improving effectiveness. We’ve pointed out that a well-defined set of tags within your organization will allow you to relate AWS usage and consumption to teams responsible for the resources and business purpose for which they exist, in order to align with organizational strategy and value.\"\"\""
