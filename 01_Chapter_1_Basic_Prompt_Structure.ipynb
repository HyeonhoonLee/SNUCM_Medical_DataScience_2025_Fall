When you ask a question or give a command, these assistants use NLP to understand what you're saying. They break down your words into smaller parts, determine the meaning behind them, and then respond in a way that makes sense.\n",

They look at the words, the order of the words, the context, and other factors to understand what the text is saying. Then, they can generate a response or perform an action based on that understanding.\n",

            "**Purpose**  \n",
            "Wegovy is a prescription medication approved by the FDA (U.S.) and other regulatory agencies for **chronic weight management** in adults with:  \n",
            "- A **body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30** (obesity) or **BMI ≥ 27** (overweight) with at least one weight-related condition (e.g., hypertension, type 2 diabetes).  \n",
            "It is **not** a replacement for diet and exercise but is used alongside lifestyle changes to enhance weight loss.  \n",
            "\n",
            "---  \n",
            "\n",
            "### **Mechanism of Action**  \n",
            "- Wegovy contains **semaglutide**, a **GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) receptor agonist**.  \n",
            "- **How it works**:  \n",
            "  1. **Appetite suppression**: Mimics GLP-1, a hormone released after eating that signals satiety to the brain, reducing hunger.  \n",
            "  2. **Slows gastric emptying**: Food stays in the stomach longer, promoting fullness.  \n",
            "  3. **Potential effects on brain reward centers**: May reduce cravings for high-calorie foods.  \n",
            "\n",
            "*(Note: Semaglutide is also used in lower doses for type 2 diabetes under the brand name Ozempic, but Wegovy is specifically approved for weight loss at a higher dose.)*  \n",

            "### **Dosage & Administration**  \n",

            "- **Dosage escalation** (to minimize side effects):  \n",
            "  - Start with **0.25 mg** weekly for 4 weeks → increase to **0.5 mg** for 4 weeks → **1.0 mg** for 4 weeks → **1.7 mg** (maintenance dose).  \n",
            "- **Missed dose**: Administer within 5 days of the missed dose; otherwise, skip and resume the regular schedule.  \n",

            "  - Higher efficacy than older weight-loss drugs (e.g., phentermine-topiramate, liraglutide/Saxenda).  \n",

            "- **Gallbladder issues** (e.g., gallstones).  \n",
